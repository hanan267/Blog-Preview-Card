## 💻 My Process

### Built With

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS3
* Flexbox
* Responsive design with media queries
* [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) starter files

### What I Learned

While working on this challenge, I practiced:

* Writing semantic and accessible HTML structure
* Styling components using CSS Flexbox
* Using `:hover` and `:focus` pseudo-classes to improve UX
* Implementing responsive design principles using media queries

```html
<article class="card">
  <h1 class="card-title">Blog Title</h1>
</article>
```

```css
.card:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

* Refine accessibility practices (keyboard navigation, ARIA)
* Use modern CSS tools like Grid and custom properties
* Explore adding transitions and animations for improved UX

### Useful Resources

* [MDN Web Docs - Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)
* [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
